The official GitHub repositories for DashPad have been created, and we're one step closer to becoming a source-available project! While this is a big step forward, all builds and source code will remain private for a while longer as there are still many areas that need refining.

<!-- more -->

**What's happening now**: The immediate focus is on squashing some final bugs, making a few needed optimizations, and (perhaps most importantly) developing comprehensive documentation to help future users get DashPad up and running on their own systems. Many parts of the module system need more refinement before new features can be added as well.

In the meantime, for anyone curious about the project's journey, architecture, and performance, I invite you to check out a recently completed report on hosting this project in a hybrid environment (API container self-hosted, Web container on Google Cloud Platform). It covers everything from the microservices design and cloud deployment process to surprising cost-efficiency of running the application.

To be continued! ðŸ˜Š
