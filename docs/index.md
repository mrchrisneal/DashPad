# DashPad

A modular system monitoring solution designed to repurpose old tablets as dedicated system metrics displays.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
- DashPad is *alpha software* in active development, created and maintained by a single hobbyist developer. 
- This documentation is a work-in-progress and may change significantly.

## What is DashPad?

DashPad transforms old, unused tablets (namely iPads) into real-time system monitoring displays for your servers. Built with a microservices architecture, it provides comprehensive infrastructure monitoring with minimal resource usage.

DashPad traces its origins to 2024 as a basic, single-container solution to monitor unRAID server metrics in near-real-time. The project saw major development in mid-2025 where it was used as part of an educational project. 

### Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Updates every 2-60 seconds
- **Tablet Optimized**: Responsive interface designed for iPad and other tablets
- **Multi-Server Support**: Monitor multiple systems from one dashboard
- **Modular Design**: Enable only the metrics you need
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage on both server and tablet

## DashPad is for you if...

- You have old tablets gathering dust
- You want lightweight system monitoring without a database
- You prefer simple, visual monitoring displays
- You run home servers or small infrastructure
- You value resource efficiency
- You want at-a-glance system health visibility

## DashPad is NOT for you if...

- You need historical data storage or trending
- You require complex alerting rules
- You want a full monitoring stack
- You need Windows support
- You require user management or multi-tenancy
- You need to monitor many dozens of servers 
- You're uncomfortable leaving electronics on and plugged in constantly

## Architecture Overview

DashPad consists of two primary microservices:

| Component | Description | Deployment |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **[DashPad-API](api/index.md)** | Backend data collection service | Local server only |
| **[DashPad-Web](web/index.md)** | Frontend monitoring interface | Local or cloud |

**Important**: The API container must run directly on the Linux server being monitored, as it requires direct access to system files like `/proc`. Only the Web container can be deployed to the cloud.

## Available Metrics

- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, RAM usage, system uptime
- **Log Monitoring**: Real-time system log viewing
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron job monitoring
- **Alerts**: Netdata integration for system alerts
