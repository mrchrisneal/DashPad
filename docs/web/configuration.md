# Configuration Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for all the environment variables used to configure the DashPad-Web container. A proper configuration is key to tailoring the dashboard to your specific needs, from defining API servers to enhancing security.

All configuration for the DashPad-Web container is managed exclusively through environment variables. This design choice provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to use the same Docker image across different environments without any changes. It simplifies deployments for local setups using docker run or Docker Compose, and is especially powerful for cloud-based platforms where environment variables are the standard for injecting configuration.

!!! abstract "Important Concepts"
    * **Configuration Method:** All settings for the DashPad-Web container are managed exclusively through environment variables.
    * **Server Definitions:** Define each `DashPad-API` server you wish to monitor using a sequentially numbered block of variables (e.g., `SERVER1_...`, `SERVER2_...`, etc.).
    * **Reference Example:** Full `docker-compose.yml` [examples](#full-docker-compose-example) for Linux and unRAID servers are provided at the end of this guide.

## Configuration Summary

The following tables provide a quick reference for all available environment variables. While many variables are (hopefully!) somewhat self-explanatory, detailed explanations for each variable can be found in the [Variable Details](#variable-details) section below.

### Core Configuration

| Variable | Default | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | `user` | `-e AUTH_USERNAME=admin` |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | `password`| `-e AUTH_PASSWORD=mysecret` |
| `USE_HTTPS` | `true` | `-e USE_HTTPS=false` |
| `PORT` | `5240` | `-e PORT=8080` |

### Server Definitions

| Variable                 | Required | Example |
|:-------------------------| :--- | :--- |
| `SERVERX_NAME`           | Yes | `-e SERVER1_NAME=unraid` |
| `SERVERX_URL`            | Yes | `-e SERVER1_URL=https://192.168.1.100:5241`|
| `SERVERX_KEY`            | Yes | `-e SERVER1_KEY=a1b2...` |
| `SERVERX_SSLFINGERPRINT` | No | `-e SERVER1_SSLFINGERPRINT=AA:BB...` |

!!! warning "Server Numbering"
    When configuring servers, it is important to replace the "X" in all `SERVERX_` variables with a number. The numbering should be sequential, beginning with `SERVER1_`, followed by `SERVER2_`, and so on:

    - `SERVER1_NAME`
    - `SERVER1_URL`
    - `SERVER1_KEY`
    - `SERVER2_NAME`
    - `SERVER2_URL`
    - `SERVER2_KEY`
    - ...

### Security Configuration

| Variable | Default | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SKIP_SSL_FINGERPRINT_VERIFICATION` | `false` | `-e SKIP_SSL_FINGERPRINT_VERIFICATION=true` |

### Development Configuration

| Variable | Default | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` | `false` | `-e DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true` |

## Variable Details

### Core Variables
* **`AUTH_USERNAME`**: The username required to access the web UI via Basic Authentication. It is highly recommended to change this from the default value for any deployment.
* **`AUTH_PASSWORD`**: The password required for web UI access. Always change this to a strong, unique password.
* **`USE_HTTPS`**: Toggles HTTPS for the web UI. If set to `false`, the container serves content over HTTP. This should only be done if you are running DashPad-Web behind another reverse proxy (like Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager--or on a service like Google Cloud Run) that is already handling SSL termination.
* **`PORT`**: The internal port that the NGINX server listens on inside the container. You map a host port to this value in your Docker command (e.g., `-p 8080:5240` would make the UI accessible on port 8080 on your host).

### Server Definition Variables
These variables must be defined in sequential blocks for each `DashPad-API` instance you wish to monitor.

* **`SERVERX_NAME`**: A unique, friendly name for the server (e.g., `main-server`, `backup-nas`). This name is used for display purposes in the UI and should not contain spaces or special characters (dashes are okay).
* **`SERVERX_URL`**: The full HTTPS URL of the `DashPad-API` instance. The connection from DashPad-Web to the API is always encrypted, so this **must** start with `https://`.
* **`SERVERX_KEY`**: The 64-character hexadecimal API key generated by the corresponding `DashPad-API` instance. On startup, the container performs a test connection to validate this key. If validation fails, the server will be disabled for monitoring.
* **`SERVERX_SSLFINGERPRINT`**: The SHA-256 fingerprint of the API server's SSL certificate. This is the most secure way to ensure you are connecting to the correct server and is highly recommended for production environments.

!!! warning "Remember to replace the "X" in all `SERVERX_` variables with a number as described previously." 

!!! note "Obtaining An SSL Fingerprint"
    You can get the SHA-256 fingerprint directly from your `DashPad-API` container's logs on its first startup. Alternatively, you can use this `openssl` command from a machine that can reach the API server:
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect <API_HOST>:<API_PORT> -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout -in /dev/stdin
    ```
    Make sure to replace `<API_HOST>` and `<API_PORT>` with your server's information!

### Security Variable
* **`SKIP_SSL_FINGERPRINT_VERIFICATION`**: If set to `true`, the container will not validate the SSL certificate fingerprints of the backend API servers. This is useful for quick tests or in environments with frequently changing certificates, but it is **not recommended for production** environments.

!!! danger "Production Security"
    For any production environment, you should always set `SKIP_SSL_FINGERPRINT_VERIFICATION` to `false` and provide the correct `SSLFINGERPRINT` for each server. The fingerprint is a unique identifier for your API server's certificate. Verifying it ensures that you are establishing a secure connection to a trusted endpoint and helps protects your API keys from being exposed in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Development Variable
* **`DEVELOPMENT_MODE`**: If set to `true`, this disables authentication for source maps and other asset files, making it easier to use browser-based debugging tools to inspect the original Svelte code. This parameter can significantly impact overall performance and should never be enabled in a production environment.

        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

!!! question "Why is a Volume Recommended?"
    While all primary configuration is indeed handled by environment variables, mounting a volume to the `/data` directory inside the container is recommended for two key reasons:

    1.  **Performance:** The container caches the SSL certificates of your backend API servers in the `/data` directory. By using a persistent volume, the container can reuse these certificates on restart, which significantly speeds up the startup process, especially in multi-server setups.
    2.  **Resilience:** If an API server is temporarily offline when you restart the DashPad-Web container, having a cached certificate allows the container to start up successfully and continue monitoring your other online servers. Without a volume, the startup would fail for that server until it comes back online.

    You can run the container without a volume (it will operate in "ephemeral mode"), but you will see a warning in the logs, and performance will be reduced on every restart.
